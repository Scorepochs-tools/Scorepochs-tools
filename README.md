**Scorepochs** aims to represent a simple tool for automatic scoring of resting-state M/EEG epochs to provide an accurate yet objective method to aid M/EEG experts during epoch selection procedure.

This approach, which works at subject level, provides a score for each epoch within a single M/EEG trace with the attempt to make this crucial procedure less ambiguous, more objective and reproducible.
